  <h4>Campus Recruitment Project is based on Random Forest Classifier. Due to very small dataset, the accuracy is not guaranteed!</h4>

## :innocent: Motivation
Campus Recruitment depends on various things. As documents go, there are certain criteria to be eligible for one! So this project helps visualize the data and the person can understand how each feature is correlated with one other be it marks or a degree! 


## :warning: Tech/framework used

- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)
- [Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)


## :star: Features
Campus Recruitment Data Visualization is accurate and can be used with similar dataset with little modifications.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XDte2DL2Mf_hw4NsmGst7QtYoU7sMBVG?usp=sharing)

This dataset consists ofÂ __3835 images__Â belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 1916 images__
*	__without_mask: 1919 images__

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

* __Bing Search API__ ([See Python script](https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection/blob/master/search.py))
* __Kaggle datasets__ 
* __RMFD dataset__ ([See here](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset))

## :key: Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code> [See here](https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection/blob/master/requirements.txt)

## ðŸš€&nbsp; Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo and create a Python virtual environment named 'test'
```
$ mkvirtualenv test
```

3. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## :bulb: Working

1. Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory folder and type the following command:
```
$ python3 train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset
```

2. Now detect the face masks in images 
```
$ python3 detect_mask_image.py --image images/pic1.jpeg
```

3. Detection in real-time video streams
```
$ python3 detect_mask_video.py 
```
## :key: Results

#### Our model gave 93% accuracy for Face Mask Detection after training via <code>tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0</code>
