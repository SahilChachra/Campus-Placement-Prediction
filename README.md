## :innocent: Motivation
Campus Recruitment depends on various things. As documents go, there are certain criteria to be eligible for one! So this project helps visualize the data and the person can understand how each feature is correlated with one other be it marks or a degree! 

## :star: Features
Campus Recruitment Data Visualization is accurate and can be used with similar dataset with little modifications.
